        <h3>Use Case - Geofinancial for retail</h3>
          <h5>Context</h5>
	    <p>Our client, a French specialized retail player, was considering merging with one of its two main competitors. The top management asked us to review, beyond the traditional financial analysis, the actual synergies and cannibalization within the potential newly enlarged network.</p>  
	  <h5>Our Solution</h5>
	<div class="list-style">
		<ul>
                <li>In a preparatory phase, we reviewed, cleansed and restructured our client 	&rsquo; s database. Then, we gathered data about all competitors &rsquo; locations which we enriched also with socio-demographic data, transport data, cell phone network data.</li>
                <li>During the first phase of our analysis, we confronted the geographic footprint and catchment areas of all the players to identify the overlaps and the synergies. In the second phase, using our client &rsquo; s data we profiled their customer base using a combination of machine-learning techniques. Finally, we computed potential sales of the new ensemble based both on our geographic analysis and our customer analysis.</li>
                <li>Overall,  our models suggested that our client could increase sales by about 12% by acquiring the firm they considering biding for.</li>

        <h3>Use Case - Marketing Mix Modelling</h3>
          <h5>Context</h5>
	    <p>Our client, a large French fashion brand with a sizeable fleet of physical stores, had recently invested heavily in digital communication to increase sales. The firm was reflecting on the effectiveness of their marketing input and requested us to perform an assessment after 6 months of digital campaign.</p>  
	  <h5>Our Solution</h5>
	<div class="list-style">
		<ul>
                <li>First, we gathered the relevant data.  Then, we linked our interest variables (sales in store, online sales, market share) with our predictors (distribution, TV spends, digital spends, outdoor spends, paper media spends etc... for the firm along with estimations for the competition).</li>
                <li>We used multivariate non-linear models in order to take into account threshold effects, diminishing returns or carry-over effects which are characteristic of marketing campaign.</li>
                <li>We were able to find that the recent digital campaign did not manage to increase sharply sales because it coincided with another large campaign from a competitor, whereas we found that outdoor and paper spends, regardless of the timing where efficient in lifting up sales over a 3-months horizon.</li>

        <h3>Use Case - Human Resources Analytics</h3>
          <h5>Context</h5>
	    <p>Our client, a large software company, had come to realize that employee turnover cost about &euro;4 M per year to the firm. With nearly 70 high performing sales leaving every year, the firm was facing the cost of opportunity of lost deals along with the extra recruitment cost. The firm wanted to set up an HR Analytics capability in order to identify employee attrition factors, predict quality of potential hires and analyze payroll policy.</p>  
	  <h5>Our Solution</h5>
	<div class="list-style">
		<ul>
                <li>First, we gathered the available data regarding employees, defined with the client what metrics where the most relevant ones especially the ones regarding quality/success of an employee.</li>
                <li>We analyzed employee attrition and quality using machine learning techniques similar to those employed for customer churn prediction.</li>
                <li>Our main findings where that sales who did not get a promotion after 3 years within the firm, those who commute more than 45 minutes to work and those who did not have a pay hike of 5% or more over the last 2 years were the most likely to leave. We also found the most successful sales where those who travel more than 80 days per year, whose variable income in their total package is slightly more important and those who have been in the sector at least for 3 years.</li>
		<li>Based on these findings, the client has started testing a new set of questions for its recruitment and also tested different payroll policies.</li>

        <h3>Use Case - Algorithm review prior to acquisition</h3>
          <h5>Context</h5>
	    <p>Our client, a European private equity company, was about to acquire a food delivery start-up. One of the key element that drove the target&rsquo;s profitability was it&rsquo;s ability to predict orders and adapt inventory and personnel adequately. Our team was asked to review the actual accuracy of the models and its reliability over the long run before the transaction.</p>  
	  <h5>Our Solution</h5>
	<div class="list-style">
		<ul>
                <li>First, we gathered and reviewed the available data. Based on documentation and explanatory notes from the target company, we replicated as closely as possible their models. We run forecasts and compared our own findings with those of the company.</li>
                <li>Then, in a second step, we created a new set of data, with very different features from the original and asked the company to run its models with the new database.</li>
                <li>Overall, we were able to tell our client that the target had a robust, flexible modeling, compatible with the project of the geographic extension of the target.</li>

        <h3>Use Case - FX Modelling</h3>
          <h5>Context</h5>
	    <p>Our client, a major European luxury goods manufacturer, manages both cash flows and the value of assets and liabilities in more than 15 different currencies, from major currency pairs (EUR-USD, EUR-GBP, EUR-CHF, EUR-JPY etc.) to more exotic ones (EUR-BRL, EUR-RUB, EUR-CNY etc.). </p>
	     <p>As a rule of thumb, they systematically hedged above certain thresholds (in current euros) and below a certain hedging cost. However, the ALM and Treasury departments were looking to enhance FX management, in order to turn their systematic process into a strategic decision making one.</p>  
	  <h5>Our Solution</h5>
	<div class="list-style">
		<ul>
                <li>First, we reviewed past hedging decisions since 2005 and supported the base work on the dataset (cleaning, harmonizing, adding variables). Second, we created a set of models for each currency pair. Models included a range of fundamental models (PPP, FEER, NEER etc.), technical models (ARIMAX, filters etc.) and aggregation models using professional surveys.</li>
                <li>Next, we implemented a dynamic-aggregation method based on past performances of each models, in order to obtain forecasts for each pair at 1M, 3M and 12M horizons.</li>
                <li>Finally, we back-tested the proposed solutions and delivered a toolbox that could have generated additional earnings on average since 1999 (excluding transaction costs).</li>
